1. stage-a: Get the basic app running

- Files copied and set up from JS files emitted by TS
- Only code change -> ../../public ../public
- App is up
- /explorer available -> components work
- /ping available -> controllers work
- / loads -> - static assets served
- Code is messy for "human consumption" :D

2. stage-b: Optimize code for "human consumption"

- Created helper file for common utility functions
- Functionality intact
